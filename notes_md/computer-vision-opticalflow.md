### RGB camera + optical flow
`Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movemement of object or camera. It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second. `  [-- Lucas Kanade / Open Source Computer Vision](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_lucas_kanade.html)

## background notes on shiffman and agent-based systems (eg flocking)
if you're new to agent-based systems, daniel shiffman has a great introduction to the agents in the [_nature of code_](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) / [video](https://vimeo.com/63928274), so please check them out if you'd like a more in depth look at how they work in processing.

here are some links to the original flocking code by Shiffman (which are in turn adaptations of work done by [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/boids.html)):
