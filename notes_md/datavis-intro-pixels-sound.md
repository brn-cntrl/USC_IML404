# IML404 // Datavis Intro: Pixels[] + Sound

I think it's common for people to think of data visualization as turning excel spreadsheets into charts and graphs (and we'll works with a few .csv files next week), but there's quite a bit of data available in some of the examples we've already worked with.  For example, in the first week of class we visualized optical flow vectors as lines with the line color and orientation  driven my the underlying algorithm (even the density of the lines is determined by the grid resolution).

Or we can build on one of our other examples to change the size of an agent based on its speed: [CODE/PROCESSING/AGENTS/Flocking_OpticalFlow](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/tree/master/CODE/PROCESSING/AGENTS/Flocking_OpticalFlow)

## pixels[]
We've been working with the RGB camera for optical flow, but we can also do some interesting things with the *pixels[]* we're capturing.  To start off, please review Shiffman's discussion of [*Images and Pixels*](https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/) on the Processing website.
