# IML404 // Tangible + Spatial Computing // USC MA+P S19   

## PROCESSING PROJECT 02 // DUE 04/06/2020
work with one of the topics or technologies we discussed in class, including: 
- [data visualization (spreadsheets, pixels, or sound)](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/datavis-intro-pixels-sound.md)
- [3D sensors (kinect, leap motion, realsense, iphoneX + capture)](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/tree/master/notes_md/computer-vision-kinect.md)
- [machine learning ([ANN](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/ML_ANN.md) / [Teachable Machine 2](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/ML_TeachableMachine2.md))
to generate your own art or design work in processing (or P5JS), and be sure the think about your model for HCI (Human Computer Interaction -- how the user will interact with your work). note: if you've chosen to work on a data visualization, you should still think about how to interact with the system.

this is a fairly open brief, so feel free to present tangential ideas for projects; however, i would like you to work with at least one of the topics listed above.
     
optionally, you can build on your RGB camera work from [PROCESSING PROJECT 01](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/processing-project.md), though make sure you've done an additional project's worth of work (let's discuss).

### IN-CLASS DEMO + THINGS TO TURN IN TO THE GOOGLE DRIVE:
- in-class video or web cam demo (feel free to just play your documentation video since we'll all be remote)
- your source code (zipped root folder with all pde files + the _data_ folder: images, shaders, etc)
- a txt document with your work's title and one or two sentences about the project 
- single representative photo / screen capture, ~1920x1080px. if your had many iterations of your project that you liked, you optionally can turn in a folder with multiple images.
- 30s to 2m video documentation... ~720p turned in or posted to vimeo/youtube/similar. feel free to use screen capture (quicktime player... new screen recording) and / or camera footage (e.g. a camera pointed at you and the computer / projection screen). this class isn't about professional documentation and graphics (though feel free to add a title and make your video look nice), it's more about capturing how someone interacts with your work via the camera... though keep in mind that most of the world will probably only see your work through documentation, so make it good! 
- _optional_: WIP (_work in progress_) dev work: sketches or images
- _optional_: in addition to turning work into moodle, if you want to gather all the above material onto a website (personal, github, etc), please feel free to do so! this could be particularly useful if you want to document process on the project. ideally this work will be a nice portfolio piece that you'll be proud to share.
