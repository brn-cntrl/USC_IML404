# IML404 // Tangible + Spatial Computing // USC MA+P S19   

## PROCESSING PROJECT 01 // DUE 02/24/2019
use an RGB camera as an input device to interact with or generate your own art or design work in processing (or P5JS). this is a fairly open brief, so feel free to present tangential ideas for projects; however, i would like you to work with an RGB camera, and i would like your project to address human computer interaction (~gesture).
     
consider building on the examples we developed in class -- [open cv](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/computer-vision-webcam-opencv.md), [optical flow](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/computer-vision-opticalflow.md), [optical flow + agentâ€“based systems](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/computer-vision-opticalflow-NOC.md), and/or [shaders](https://github.com/johnbcarpenter/USC_IML404/blob/master/notes_md/shaders.md).

### IN-CLASS DEMO + THINGS TO TURN IN TO THE GOOGLE DRIVE:
- in-class demo
- your source code (zipped root folder with all pde files + the _data_ folder: images, shaders, etc)
- a txt document with your work's title and one or two sentences about the project 
- single representative photo / screen capture, ~1920x1080px. if your had many iterations of your project that you liked, you optionally can turn in a folder with multiple images.
- 30s to 2m video documentation... ~720p turned in or posted to vimeo/youtube/similar. feel free to use screen capture (quicktime player... new screen recording) and / or camera footage (e.g. a camera pointed at you and the computer / projection screen). this class isn't about professional documentation and graphics (though feel free to add a title and make your video look nice), it's more about capturing how someone interacts with your work via the camera... though keep in mind that most of the world will probably only see your work through documentation, so make it good! 
- _optional_: WIP (_work in progress_) dev work: sketches or images
- _optional_: in addition to turning work into moodle, if you want to gather all the above material onto a website (personal, github, etc), please feel free to do so! this could be particularly useful if you want to document process on the project. ideally this work will be a nice portfolio piece that you'll be proud to share.
